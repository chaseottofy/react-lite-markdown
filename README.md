# markdown lite

Simple version of markdown I plan on using for personal note-taking. This is my first project using React after years of vanilla JS. I have to admit... the hype is well warranted. Using this framework (or library?) almost feels like cheating at times.

## Five total commands

```javascript
#              header
*text*         bold text
(text)         blue text
[text](link)   link
```            code block
```
